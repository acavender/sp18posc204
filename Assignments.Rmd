#Assignments and Grading

This course has midterm and final assessments, each of which is worth 150 points.

##Assignments

Additionally, students will complete the following assignments designed to help them achieve the course goals:

* [Course survey and initial PDF submission](https://goo.gl/forms/pjF7VL0VCtLUVqvU2): 25 points
* [Essay 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B9xkijD57YetsaujNkmHgeRQYxPf3i4r/view?usp=sharing): 150 points
* Essay 2: 150 points
* Article review: 150 points
* Annotated bibliography: 125 points
* Discussion question submission and leadership: 100 points

That makes for a total of 1000 points available for the semester. 

##Grading

Final grades will be calculated as follows:

* A = 930 – 1000
*  A- = 900 – 929
* B+ = 880 – 899
* B = 830 – 879
* B- = 800 – 829
* C+ = 780 – 799
* C = 730 – 779
* C- = 700 – 729
* D = 600 – 699
* F = \< 600

*Please note that no extra credit is available in this course.*
